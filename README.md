# Selenium Web Scraping
## Scraping Some Instagram Data 

Instagram took down quite a few API's after data breaches over the past few years. This is a simple web scraping script to try and recreate some of the API's that were taken away. 

This is somewhat a sample method to use selenium and scrap data, here we scrape the followers and following users for the logged in account. The script can be tweaked and scrape the data for any public account as well by just changing the url.
